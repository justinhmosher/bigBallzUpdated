    <h2>Team Composition</h2>
    <p>Team: Consists of two NFL players (Running Back, Wide Receiver, Tight End, or Quarter Back - rushing only) on separate NFL rosters.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team costs $50 to buy.</li>
        <li>You can buy a minimum of 1 team and a maximum of 20 teams.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>User: A person who signs up for The Chosen and purchases 1 or more teams.</p>
    
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The game starts on Tuesday, week 1 of the NFL season.</li>
        <li>On that Tuesday, you select two players per team to score a touchdown and one or more offensive yards.</li>
        <li>If one or both players score a touchdown and one or more offensive yards, then that team moves onto the following week.</li>
        <li>If both players DO NOT score a touchdown, then that team is eliminated.
            <ul>
                <li>You may choose/change player selections at any time Tuesday and Wednesday.</li>
                <li>Starting Thursday, you may no longer choose/change players.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Steps 1-4 are repeated until week 18.</li>
        <li>If a player scores a touchdown and one or more offensive yards for a team at any point in the season, you may no longer select that player to score FOR THAT TEAM ONLY.
            <ul>
                <li>You may still select that player to a touchdown for a different team.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The user with the last team remaining wins the pot!</li>
        <li>If there are multiple teams in after week 18, then the pot is split amongst the users proportional to how many surviving teams they have.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        A user paid $250 for 5 teams. It is now week 7 of the NFL season and the user has 2 teams remaining, and the user selects the following players to score a touchdown and one or more offensive yards:
        <br>Team 1 = Travis Kelce or Tyreek Hill
        <br>Team 2 = Austin Eckler or Mike Evans
        <br>If Travis Kelce, Mike Evans, and Tyreek Hill score a touchdown and one or more offensive yards that week, then both teams stay alive!
    </p>
    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
    <p>
        Team 1 will no longer be able to select Travis Kelce, nor Tyreek Hill for the remainder of the season, and team 2 will no longer be able to select Mike Evans for the remainder of the season. However, team 2 may still be able to pick Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill (assuming they havenâ€™t already scored a TD for Team 2), and likewise with Mike Evans on team 1.
