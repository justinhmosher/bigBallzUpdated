                <h3>Game Rules</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pick two players to score a touchdown every week.</li>
                    <li>If ONE OR BOTH score a touchdown, you move onto the next week.</li>
                    <li>If NEITHER score a touchdown, you are out!</li>
                    <li>Once a player scores for you, you may no longer reselect them.</li>
                    <li>Last man standing wins the pot!</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Eligible picks:</strong> QB, RB, WR, TE</p>
                <p><em>*QB must score a rushing or receiving touchdown. Throwing touchdowns will not count.</em></p>
                <p><em> Due to fantasy sports law, an additional statistic is required.  We made sure to choose one which is highly correlated; the scoring player must have 1 or more offensive yards for the touchdown to count.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules">
                <h3>How the Pot is Split</h3>
                <p>The prize pot will be split amongst the remaining users at the end of the tournament. For example, if no users are left to start Week 10, the pot will be split amongst the users that were in to start Week 9.</p>
                <p>The league will only extend through the regular season. If any users are still standing at the end of Week 18, the pot will be split amongst those users.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules">
                <h3>Pick Deadlines</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight">IMPORTANT:</span> You are eligible to enter your picks anytime before the tournament starts, or from 12:00am PST on Tuesday until 11:59pm PST on Wednesday each week.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight">THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS.</span> IF A PICK IS NOT ENTERED ON TIME, YOU WILL BE OUT!</p>
                <p>Any other time of each week, you will see the quantity of picks placed on each player. This will help you decide who to root for or against!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rules">
                <h3>Entry Limit</h3>
